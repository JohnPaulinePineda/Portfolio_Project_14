This [project](https://johnpaulinepineda.github.io/Portfolio_Project_14/) explores the various cost-sensitive procedures for handling imbalanced data for classification. Methods applied in the analysis to address imbalanced data included model structures which support cost-sensitive learning, namely Class-Weighted Support Vector Machine, Cost-Sensitive Classification and Regression Trees and Cost-Sensitive C5.0 Decision Trees. The resulting predictions derived from the candidate models were evaluated in terms of their discrimination power on the minority class using the specificity metric. The specificity values were compared to those of the baseline models without cost-sensitive learning applied.
